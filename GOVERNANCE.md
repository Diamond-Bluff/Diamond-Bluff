# Diamond Bluff

For an idea of what the goals of the Diamond Bluff project are, please see the
[high level overview document](README.md).

## Governance

### Governance Goals

The goal of governance for the Diamond Bluff project is to maintain and
emphasize a technical meritocracy of contributors. Those who contribute the
most and the best technical solutions, while supporting all contirbutors, have
the most influence in the technical direction of the project. At the same
time, a [Board of Directors](#Board of Directors) is established with it's
own set of responsibilities, to help manage the Diamond Bluff project.

## Membership

The Diamond Bluff project is composed of Platinum, Silver, and Participating
Academic members. All Platinum and Silver members must be current corporate
members of the hosting foundation (e.g. Linux Foundation or Open Infrastructure
Foundation) at any level to participate in the Diamond Bluff project.

Platinum, Silver and Participating Academic Members shall be entitled to:

* Participate in the Diamond Bluff Project meetings, initiatives, events and
  any other activities.
* Identify their company or academic institution as a member or participant in
  the Diamond Bluff project.
* Platinum members shall be entitled to appoint a representative to the
  Board of Directors of the Diamond Bluff project, as well as any future
  committees established by the Board of Directors.

## Structure

At a high level, the Diamond Bluff project is governed by two main bodies which
work together to achieve the project's goals:

* A Board of Directors
* A Technical Steering Committee

### Board of Directors

The Diamond Bluff project Board of Directors shall be composed as follows:

* One representative from each Platinum member.
* One Silver member representative elected annually by the Silver members for
  every 5 (or fraction thereof) Silver members, with at least one
  representative, and no more than 3.

The Board of Directors shall have the following responsibilities:

* Approve a budget directing the use of funds raised from all sources of
  revenue.
* Elect a Chair of the Diamond Bluff project to preside over meetings,
  authorize expenditures approved by the budget, and manage any day-to-day
  operations, and vote on decisions or matters before the Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors shall:

* Demonstrate plans and the means to coordinate with the open source project’s
  developer community, including on topics such as branding, logos, and other
  collateral that will represent the community.
* Engage in a professional manner consistent with maintaining a cohesive
  community, while also maintaining the goodwill and esteem of the project's
  foundation, in the open source software community.
  community.
* Respect the rights of all trademark owners, including any branding and usage
  guidelines.
* Engage the project's foundation for all press and analyst relations activities.
* Upon request, provide information regarding project participation, including
  information regarding attendance at project-sponsored events, to the
  project's foundation.
* Engage the project's foundation for any Diamond Bluff project websites, and
  operate under such rules and procedures as may from time to time be approved
  by the Diamond Bluff Board of Directors and confirmed by the project's
  foundation.

For any of the above responsibilities, the Board may delegate their powers to
one or more parties as appropriate and necessary, under terms set by the Board.

### Technical Steering Committee

Members of the Diamond Bluff Technical Steering Committee (TSC) decide
technical matters that affect the entire project, administer joint
project-wide technical resources, and act as a final arbiter of technical
matters that are not decided inside individual sub-projects.

#### TSC Membership

All TSC members must be currently contributing engineers, documentation
writers, test platform adminstrators, specification editors, or other direct
technical contributors to one or more sub-projects. TSC members need not be
employees of sponsoring organizations.

During the first year of of the project, The TSC shall be composed as follows:

* One appointed representative from each Platinum member
* One maintainer from each Diamond Bluff sub-project, selected by the Board

Starting one year after the launch of the Diamond Bluff governance, the TSC
composition will become:

* Two maintainers from each Diamond Bluff sub-project
* Two technical contributors appointed by the Board

Membership in the TSC will gradually transition to a model of elected
sub-project technical leadership, starting in the second year of the project.
Details for this transition will be decided by the Board.

Starting in the second year of the project, no individual may hold a seat on
the Board and the TSC at the same time. No more than 40% of TSC members may be
employed by the same organization.

Should any TSC member cease regular technical contributions, their membership
will terminate at the next regular annual selection date. If a TSC member
violates the Code of Conduct, they may be removed from the TSC by the Code of
Conduct Committee.

#### TSC Responsibilities

The responsibilities of the Diamond Bluff Technical Steering Committee are
as follows:

* Coordinating the technical direction of the Diamond Bluff Project
* Nominating and reviewing new sub-projects for creation under the Diamond
  Bluff organization after final approval by the Board.
* Confirming selected maintainers in the sub-projects, and ensuring they have
  the technical support necessary to be successful in their role as a
  maintainer.
* Communicating with external and industry organizations concering Diamond
  Bluff technical matters.
* Appointing represenatives to work with other open source or open standards
  communities.
* Voting on technical matters relating to any common code base or
  specifications affecting all sub-projects.
* Adminstering common technical resources, such as repository hosting and the
  testing infrastructure.
* Acting as "court of final appeal" for technical matters which are not
  resolved through normal decision mechanisms within the individual
  sub-projects.
* Coordinating response to security issues and ensuring that all sub-projects
  are reasonably secure.

For any of the above responsibilities, the TSC may delegate their powers to one
or more parties as appropriate and necessary, under terms set by the TSC.

#### TSC Meetings

The TSC shall hold one or more public meetings each month. All contributors
to, or sponsors of, Diamond Bluff shall be entitled to attend these meetings.
Public meetings will have a public agenda to which members of the community may
reasonably add items.

The TSC may also have private meetings from time to time, particularly when
discussing security response or settling escalated disputes. All TSC members
will be included in private meetings.

### Code of Conduct Committee

The Board will appoint or elect three or more individuals to serve as a Code of
Conduct Committee (COCC). Committee members may also be members of the Board or
the TSC, or they may be outside parties (paid or unpaid) with expertise in code
of conduct (CoC) enforcement, or just members of the community. The CoCC should
be selected to represent the diversity of the community.

The CoCC will establish fair and standard processes for handling reports of violations of the CoC, as well as a system of remedies, in order to protect the well-being of the project. The CoCC will recommend the appropriate resolution to the Board, up to and including the removal of any individual from participation, either temporarily or permanently. Should a member of the CoCC itself be accused of a violation, that accusation will be handled by an individual appointed by the foundation.

## Voting

While it is the goal of the project to strive for consensus as a community, if
any decision requires a vote to move forward, either the Board of Directors
members or the Technical Steering Committee members shall be entitled to vote
on a one vote per representative basis. Decisions by vote shall be based on a
majority vote only when sixty percent (>= 60$) or greater of the voting body
representatives are either present or particiapting electronically. In the
event of a tied vote, the Chair shall be entitiled to submit a tie-breaking
vote. All elections shall be held using an online preference election mechanism
to be selected and approved by the Board.

## Budget

The Board of Directors shall approve an annual budget and never commit to spend
in excess of funds raised. The budget shall be consistent with the non-profit
mission of the Diamond Bluff project's foundation. The foundation shall provide
regular reports of spend levels against the budget.

## Amendments
This governiing document may be amended by a super majority vote of all Board
of Director members, subject to approval by foundation the project is a part
of. A super majority vote is defined as a vote in favor by 70% or great of the
Board of Directors, ignoring any abstentions.
