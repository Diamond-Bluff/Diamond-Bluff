# **Detailed Goals for Diamond Bluff**

* Create community-driven standards-based open ecosystem for DPU/IPU-like
  technologies
  * Establish an open community to support vendor-independent and jointly
    co-developed ecosystem
  * Build a truly open ecosystem that practices open source development
    principles and is always open to new members and contributors
  * Adhere to existing and commonly accepted open standards or help foster best
    practices in lieu of standards, as required
* Create vendor agnostic framework and architecture for DPU/IPU-based software
  stacks
  * Lifecycle management
    * BMC, secure boot, root of trust, loading, etc
    * Software installation, related security
  * System Integration Framework
    * Define operating environment
    * Software abstraction layer/framework
    * Support direct host access to DPU/IPU HW offloads
    * Support services distributed across host(s) and DPU/IPU(s)
  * Vendor-agnostic services
  * Telemetry → observability
* Reuse existing or define a set of new common APIs, when required, for
  * DPU/IPU hardware
  * DPU/IPU-hosted applications
  * Host Node
  * (Remote) provisioning software
  * (Remote) orchestration software
  * Configuration API per service
  * Consumption API per service
* Provide implementation examples to validate the architectures/APIs
  * Create technical papers and functional diagrams to help better understand
    the overall architecture(s)
  * Provide sample service implementations for validating frameworks
  * Develop reference proof of concept (POC) as well as simulation and test
    environments for testing APIs
